# Run mtr in report mode, providing a summary after a set number of cycles
mtr --report hostname_or_ip

# Run mtr as root to use ICMP ECHO for improved accuracy

# Set the interval between packets sent (default is one second)
mtr --interval 0.5 hostname_or_ip

# Run mtr with a specified packet size
mtr --psize 1500 hostname_or_ip

# Use TCP instead of ICMP ECHO (useful for environments with ICMP restrictions)
mtr --tcp hostname_or_ip

# Run mtr with JSON output (useful for machine parsing)
mtr --json hostname_or_ip

# Limit mtr to testing a specific number of hops
mtr --max-ttl 10 hostname_or_ip
