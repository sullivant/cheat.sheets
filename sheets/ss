# ss
# Dump socket statistics for network connections.
#
# Options:
#   -4/-6   list ipv4/ipv6 sockets
#   -n      numeric addresses instead of hostnames
#   -l      list listening sockets
#   -u/-t/-x list udp/tcp/unix sockets
#   -p      Show process(es) that using socket

# Basic usage to display all sockets
ss

# List all TCP connections
ss -t

# List all UDP connections
ss -u

# Show listening sockets
ss -l

# Display summary statistics
ss -s

# Display all sockets, including those in established state
ss -a

# Show detailed information with numeric addresses
ss -n

# Filter sockets by state (e.g., LISTEN, ESTABLISHED)
ss state LISTEN

# Display sockets of a specific protocol (e.g., TCP)
ss -t -a

# Show sockets belonging to a specific user
ss -u -p USER

# Show sockets related to a specific process
ss -p

# Display IPv4 sockets
ss -4

# Display IPv6 sockets
ss -6

# Filter based on specific ports
ss 'sport = :80' # source port 80
ss 'dport = :22' # destination port 22

# Combine filters for more refined results
ss -t -a 'dport = :22' state ESTABLISHED

# Show all listening TCP ports, including the corresponding process.
ss -tlp

# Show a summary of all ports connecting to 192.168.2.1 via port 80.
ss -t dst 192.168.2.1:80

# Show all SSH-related connection.
#
# Documentation on the filter syntax can be installed via the following command
# if on a Debian- or Ubuntu-based distribution of Linux:
#
#     sudo apt-get install iproute2-doc
#
ss -t state established '( dport = :ssh or sport = :ssh )'

# Display timer information.
ss -tno

# Filter connections by TCP state.
ss -t4 state established
