# Capture packets and save to a file
tshark -i eth0 -w capturefile.pcap

tshark -a duration:10 -i eth0

# Capture packets with a specific packet count (e.g., 100 packets)
tshark -c 100 -i eth0

# Display packets captured in real-time in human-readable form
tshark -i eth0 

# Read packets from a file
tshark -r capturefile.pcap 

# Capture packets with a specific filter (e.g., HTTP traffic)
tshark -i eth0 -f "tcp port 80"

# Capture packets and display only specific fields
tshark -i eth0 -T fields -e ip.src -e ip.dst

# Capture packets and display with time format in seconds since the Unix epoch
tshark -i eth0 -t e

# Display a summary of packets, rather than detailed packet information
tshark -q -z io,stat,1 -r capturefile.pcap

# Decode specific port traffic as a specific protocol (e.g., decode traffic on port 9999 as HTTP)
tshark -d tcp.port==9999,http -r capturefile.pcap

# Capture packets and include packet timestamp in a specific format (ISO 8601)
tshark -i eth0 -t a

# Use a specific configuration profile when capturing or reading packets
tshark -C <profile_name> -i eth0
