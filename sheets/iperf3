# Run a client test on a specified port (e.g., port 5001) of the server
iperf3 -c [server IP] -p 5001

# Run a client test with a specified number of parallel streams (e.g., 5 streams) to a server
iperf3 -c [server IP] -P 5

# Run a client test to a server using UDP (instead of the default TCP)
iperf3 -c [server IP] -u

# Run a reverse test where the server sends data to the client
iperf3 -c [server IP] -R

# Run a bidirectional test where data is exchanged in both directions
iperf3 -c [server IP] --bidir

# Display results in JSON format for easier parsing and scripting
