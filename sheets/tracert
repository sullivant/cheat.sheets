# tracert
# Windows utility equivalent to traceroute for tracking packet paths (Windows only).

# Basic Usage
tracert [hostname]

# Trace route to an IP address
tracert [IP address]

# Specify the maximum number of hops to search for the target
tracert -h [max hops] [hostname]

# Set the timeout period (in milliseconds) for each reply
tracert -w [timeout] [hostname]

# Do not resolve addresses to hostnames
tracert -d [hostname]

# Example of combining options: trace route with no DNS resolution and specific timeout
tracert -d -w 1000 [hostname]

# Run a trace route using a specific source IP address
tracert -s [source IP] [target hostname]

# Run a trace route with IPv6 (use tracert6 on older Windows version which might still have it)
tracert -6 [hostname]

# Use Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request messages
tracert -4 [hostname]
